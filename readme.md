-----

A quorum device is used to break a tie when a SAN fault occurs, when exactly half of the nodes that were previously a member of the cluster are present
The IP quorum application is a Java application that runs on a separate server or host. (This can be physical or Virtual Machine.)
An IP quorum application is used in IP networks to resolve failure scenarios where half the control canisters/nodes on the cluster become unavailable.
The application determines which nodes or enclosures can continue processing host operations and avoids a split cluster, where both halves of the system continue to process I/O independently.

IBM Storage Virtualize is Motor for IBM FlashSystem and IBM SVC
